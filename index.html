    <p>My wife and I first met in 2011, precisely on September 14. We began as friends, but as I got to know her, I found her to be cool and interesting. I started courting her in November of that same year, marking the beginning of our beautiful journey together.

    The courtship continued until June 15, 2015, when I decided to visit her parents to seek their approval (which automatically means that we were married, according to Islamic rights). On the 7th of February, 2016, she moved to my one room apartment where we started our journey </p>
